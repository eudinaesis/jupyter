When asked for input, follow the instruction for what to enter. Otherwise, make a new cell for each thing that you are asked to do and for any experiements that you wish to add in earlier in the notebook."

In fact, next year when you learn to program Arduinos you will use ArduinoC which uses a slightly differnt naming conventions. For Pythin, we use underscores to separate words and use variable names that describe what the variable stands for. "
