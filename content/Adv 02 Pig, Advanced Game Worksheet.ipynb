    "1. During their turn, a player may roll the dice as many times as they want, keeping a running total of the sums that come up as long as no 1s are rolled. When the player stops rolling, they record the total and add it to the running score from previous turns **as long as** they have not rolled any 1s.\n",
    "2. If a 1 is rolled on just one of the dice before the player decides to stop rolling, then the player gets 0 points for that turn and it's the next player's turn.\n",
